#  Student Performance Analysis

This project explores how students' demographics and test preparation impact their performance in math, reading, and writing. It uses a real dataset from Kaggle and applies basic data analysis using Python in Google Colab and Excel.

 ## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- 1000 rows, 5 features (gender, lunch, parental education, etc.) + scores

## Tools Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Excel (for basic summary analysis and charts)

---

##  Key Insights
- Reading and writing scores are strongly correlated (r = 0.95)
- Students with standard lunch scored higher on average
- Parental education may influence student performance
- Test preparation course seems to have a slight positive effect
